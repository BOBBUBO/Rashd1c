Fake Operating system in only shell :)
anyways here's how to get it
1: get the install.sh I'm to lazy to put the command here so -_-
2: make it executable (chmod +x install.sh)
3: run. for every second you're not running I'm getting closer ;).
anyway thats it do whatever you want with it I don't give a shit (clearly because I named the version gay tiger) bye see you in 2 business weeks.🐢
